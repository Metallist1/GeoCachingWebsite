              <div>
                <p>
                  A woman has to find the best pair of shoes to wear for her new dress. She has 113 pairs of shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She takes two pairs of shoes out of the closet at a time, and throws away the least fittin<strong class="glitch" data-text="g">g</strong> for her dress, until there are no more shoes in the closet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She then repeats this process with the shoes she did not throw away, until she has only one pair left â€“ the best match for her dress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  How many comparisons does she have to make, until she has the best match?
